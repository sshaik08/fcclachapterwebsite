  <h1>Promotion of Family and Consumer Sciences</h1>

  <h3>What is FCS? Why is it important?</h3>
  <p>
    The American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences (AAFCS) defines
    Family and Consumer Sciences (FCS) as a “field of study focused on the
    science and the art of living and working well in our complex world” and
    individuals who study FCS focus on helping people through research,
    education, and technology (“What is FCS?”).
  </p>

  <p>
    The primary content areas of FCS include culinary arts, hospitality,
    tourism, education, food science, nutrition, health management, housing
    and interior design, family relations, human development, finances,
    apparel, and retail. These focuses all implement aspects of
    sustainability, conscious consumption, and leadership (“What is FCS?”).
  </p>

  <h3>FCS & College and Career Readiness</h3>
  <p>
    Through FCS, students are empowered and prepared for success in college
    and career as they are taught essential life skills, such as financial
    literacy, nutrition, and human development.

  <h3>What is FCCLA? Why is it important?</h3>
  <p>
    Family, Career and Community Leaders of America, or FCCLA, is a national
    organization for students in the FCS program.

    industries with similar skills, knowledge, and goals. They help students

    interconnected careers a student can study.
