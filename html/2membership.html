  <h1>Membership Information</h1>
  <h3>Why Join?</h3>
  <p>Membership in Dupont Manual's FCCLA chapter is free for students taking an FCS class this year. This includes:
    <ul class="classes">
        <li>Fashion & Interior Design I, II</li>
        <li>Fashion & Interior Design III</li>
        <li>Foods & Nutrition (Foods 1)</li>
        <li>Advanced Foods & Nutrition (Foods 2)</li>
        <li>Nutritional and Food Sciences (Foods 3)</li>
        <li>Relationships & Parenting</li>
    </ul>
    There are many opportunities for service hours and growth. Manual's chapter doesn't require 100% attendance, so you
    can participate on your own terms and choose a level of involvement that fits your schedule.
    Possible service this year includes card making, toy drives, and fundraising. With FCCLA you are able to compete in
    STAR event competitions that align with FCS classes taught by Mrs. Spieg or Mrs. Able. 
  </p>
<p>Meetings are held every other Monday in either room 325 or 323. Join the Google Classroom with code

  for students in an FCS course this year. Follow <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fccla_dupontmanual"
